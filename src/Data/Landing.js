  Hello and welcome! I'm <strong>Manikumarreddy Gajjela</strong>, a thinker, a creator, and a lifelong learner who finds beauty in the art of development. 
  To me, coding is more than a profession—it's a canvas where logic and imagination meet to build something extraordinary.`,
para2: `
  "Code is poetry," they say, and I believe it. Every line I write is a verse, every function a stanza, 
  and every application a story brought to life. Development is not just solving problems; it's about weaving ideas into the fabric of reality, 
  one line at a time.`,
para3: `
  I see the world of technology as an infinite playground where creativity knows no bounds. 
  With every new project, I embark on a journey—a quest to transform the intangible into something meaningful, 
  to create solutions that empower, inspire, and endure.`,
